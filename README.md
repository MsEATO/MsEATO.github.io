# Executive Summary: EATO MVP0 Solution

## Introduction
EATO is a company specializing in preparing video recipes as social media content. In order to enhance user engagement and offer a convenient ordering experience, EATO aims to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP0) that includes a standalone website, a chatbot for social media platforms, and a quick order bot. This executive summary outlines the key components and benefits of the EATO MVP0 solution.

## Standalone Website

### Content Streaming
The core of the MVP0 solution revolves around the development of a powerful standalone website. This website will serve as a centralized platform for users to browse, stream, and access EATO's captivating video recipes. With a user-friendly interface, visitors can effortlessly navigate through the website to discover recipes based on specific criteria such as cuisine type, dietary preferences, and cooking time. The website will provide an immersive experience by seamlessly integrating high-quality video streaming capabilities, ensuring users can easily watch and follow along with the cooking instructions.

### E-commerce Functionality
In addition to the video streaming capabilities, the standalone website will feature a fully functional e-commerce system. Users will have the ability to order ingredient packages directly from the website, adding convenience and saving valuable time. This feature saves users time and effort by eliminating the need to individually source ingredients from different stores. The e-commerce functionality will include essential features such as comprehensive shopping carts, enabling users to add multiple recipes and ingredients to their cart for a seamless checkout experience. The website will offer a secure and efficient payment process, allowing users to complete transactions with confidence.

### Ordering and Delivery Services
With the e-commerce system in place, EATO will establish partnerships with local suppliers to ensure the availability and freshness of ingredients in the ordered packages. Once users have finalized their orders, EATO will provide reliable delivery services (with the help of partners), ensuring that the ingredient packages reach customers' doorsteps promptly and in optimal condition. The ordering and delivery processes will be optimized to offer a smooth and convenient experience for users.

NB: Wherease MVP0 seeks to supply EATO-managed ingredients only, EATO will consider establishing partnerships with local suppliers while still ensuring the availability and freshness of ingredients in the packages.

## Chatbot Integration
The EATO MVP0 solution includes a chatbot that will be integrated with major social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The chatbot will serve as a virtual assistant, engaging users in conversation, and providing them with personalized recipe recommendations, cooking tips, and ingredient *substitution suggestions* . Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions, seek assistance, or request specific recipes based on their preferences.

## Quick-Order Bot
To leverage the popularity of Instagram and enhance user convenience, EATO will develop an ordering bot specifically for this platform. The bot will monitor the comments section of EATO's Instagram channel and allow users to add a recipe box to cart or issue an order directly from the comment section. When a user issues a command under a specific recipe, the quick-order bot will prepare an order, including the required ingredients, and send a direct message to the user with the order details and a payment link. This automated process eliminates the need for users to visit the website separately, streamlining the ordering experience.

## Value Added Services
In addition to the core features outlined in the MVP0 solution, EATO will provide a range of value-added services to further enhance the user experience:

- User Profiles: Users can create accounts, save favorite recipes, customize dietary preferences, and receive personalized recommendations.
